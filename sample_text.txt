In the small, storm-battered village of Greyhaven, perched on the edge of a cliff overlooking a tempestuous sea, there lived an old man named Elias. He was the Lantern Keeper, tasked with ensuring the great lighthouse burned bright through the darkest nights. For decades, Elias tended the beacon faithfully, his light guiding sailors to safety. But Elias was a lonely man. His wife had passed years ago, and his only son, Samuel, had left for the city in search of a better life, never to return. The townsfolk admired Elias but rarely spoke to him. They whispered that he loved the lighthouse more than people. One fateful evening, a fierce storm rolled in, blackening the sky. Thunder growled like a beast, and waves crashed against the cliffs with a fury that shook the land. As Elias prepared to light the lantern, he noticed the lens was cracked. Without it, the beam would scatter uselessly, leaving sailors vulnerable to the treacherous rocks below. Elias felt a pang of panic, but his resolve hardened. He grabbed an old oil lamp from his quarters, its flame barely steady, and made his way into the storm.
